# Getting-Started-With-HTML

## Project Details:
* If you haven’t already created an HTML file to contain your notes from this section, refer back to the beginning of the lessons for setting up your file.
* To complete this project, you’ll need to submit your notes as an HTML file using the tags you learned about in these lessons, such as ```<p>```,```<div>```, ```<h1>```, ```<b>```, ```<em>```, and ```<span>```.
* Keep it simple. CSS is used for styling and is not necessary for this project.
* Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code.
