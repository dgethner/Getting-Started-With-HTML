<p><h1>The World Wide Web:</h1>
I will develop enough "technological empathy"<br>
to understand what happens when I open or<br>
make a web page.</p>

<p>I will use <b>HTML tags</b> to create a simple<br>
<b>HTML document</b> that a browser can display as a web page</p>

<b>HTML</b> - Hypertext Markup Language<br>
<b>Hyper Links</b> - connecting different webpages<br>

<p><h4>What is the main type of document on the web?</h4>
HTML</p>

<p><h4>What types of files can be found on the web?</h4>
  Plain text, HTML, IMAGES, Videos, Music</p>

<p> My browser makes requests via the Internet to servers.
These requests are using a protocol called "HTTP."
And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.</p>


<div><h4>Match the following components of the web to their respective definitions.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>the main protocol of the web - <b>HTTP</b>
    <li>computers that host the files that make up the web - <b>servers</b>
    <li>the world's largest computer network - <b>internet</b>
    <li>A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web - <b>browser</b>
  </ul>
</div>
<p><h4>HTML is made up of:</h4>
  <ul><b>
    <li>Text content
    <li>Markup - what it looks like
    <li>References to other docs
    <li>Links to other webpages
  </b></ul>
</p>
<p><b>Tag Syntax [(opening tag)<name>Contents</name>(closing tag)] Element</b></p>

<p><h3> In the box below, type out the phrase:</h3>
HTML is reasonably straightforward<br>
<span>And use HTML tags to make "reasonably straightforward" bold.</span><br>
<br> HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></p>

<p><h3> In the box below, type out the phrase:</h3>
HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b><br>
<br>
And use HTML tags to make the entire phrase italicized.<br>
<br> <em>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></em></b></p>

<p><h3>Computers Are Stupid</h3>
In spoken languages, we can craft sentences with a great deal of ambiguity. <br>
<br>Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity, but sometimes this can result in issues between the programmer and the machine.
</p>

<p><h3> What happens when we forget to close the (em) tag?</h3>
Everything after (em) is italicized</p>

<p><h3>Type out the following in the box below:</h3>
This website is my favorite<br>
<br>Then make the phrase "my favorite" into a link that goes to https://www.udacity.com
<br><br> This website is <a href="https://www.udacity.com">my favorite</a></p>

<p><h3>Images</h3>
  <img src="url" alt="text">
<br>Reasons for alt text
      <ul>
        <li>"Required"
        <li>Broken requests
        <li>Blind
      </ul>
Image tags are void tags, not needing an ending tag</p>

<p><h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Google
    <li>W3Schools
    <li>Mozilla Developer Network
  </ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Whitespace</h3>
(br) means break and is a void tag<br>
<br>(p)content(/p) means paragraph and has a closing tag
<br><h4>Make the following sentences appear as two lines rather than one continuous line. Use the (br) tag.</h4>
Hello everyone! We're using two lines now!
<br><br>
Hello everyone!<br> We're using two lines now!
<h4>Make the following sentences appear as two lines rather than one continuous line. Use two sets of (p) tags, one for each sentence.</h4>
Hello everyone! We're using two lines now!
<br>
<p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>We're using two lines now!</p>

<p><h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
(br) - inline means that the lin stops here<br>
(p) - block means that a box gets formed around the text<br>

<p><h3>Span & Div</h3>
Span is inline<br>
Div is block<br>

<p><h3>Check all the elements that are inline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>a
    <li>span
    <li>br
    <li>img
    <li>strong
  </ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Document Structure</h3>
  (!doctype html) - efines the type of the document so the browser will render it correctly <br>
  (html) - Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.<br>
  (head) - tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page<br>
    (title)Title!(/title) - tag is closed on the same line it was opened which we usually do if the content of a tag is short.<br>
  (/head) - meta-data, Javascript, CSS<br>
  (body) - otice that inside the (body) tags you have the content of the web page.<br>
  (b)content(/b)(br)
  (/body)
  (/html)</p>
<p>Writing code that people can easily read is a <b>VERY</b> important idea in computer programming.</p>
<p>In HTML particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.</p>
